= RK-API Quick Start Guide

You can access Rancher's resources through the Kubernetes API. This guide helps you get started on using this API as a Rancher user.

. In the upper left corner, click *☰ > Global Settings*.
. Find and copy the address in the `server-url` field.
. link:../reference-guides/user-settings/api-keys.adoc#creating-an-api-key[Create] a Rancher API key with no scope.
[WARNING]
====

A Rancher API key with no scope grants unrestricted access to all resources that the user can access. To prevent unauthorized use, this key should be stored securely and rotated frequently.
====


. Create a `kubeconfig.yaml` file. Replace `$SERVER_URL` with the server url and `$API_KEY` with your Rancher API key:
+
[,yaml]
----
 apiVersion: v1
 kind: Config
 clusters:
 - name: "rancher"
   cluster:
     server: "$SERVER_URL"

 users:
 - name: "rancher"
   user:
     token: "$API_KEY"

 contexts:
 - name: "rancher"
   context:
     user: "rancher"
     cluster: "rancher"

 current-context: "rancher"
----

You can use this file with any compatible tool, such as kubectl or https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go[client-go]. For a quick demo, see the <<api-kubectl-example,kubectl example>>.

For more information on handling more complex certificate setups, see <<specifying-ca-certs,Specifying CA Certs>>.

For more information on available kubeconfig options, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/[upstream documentation].

== API kubectl Example

In this example, we'll show how to use kubectl to create a project, followed by deleting it. For a list of other Rancher resources available, refer to the link:./api-reference.adocx[API Reference] page.
[NOTE]
====

At this time, not all Rancher resources are available through the Rancher Kubernetes API.
====


. Set your KUBECONFIG environment variable to the kubeconfig file you just created:

[,bash]
----
  export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/kubeconfig.yaml
----

. Use `kubectl explain` to view the available fields for projects, or complex sub-fields of resources:

[,bash]
----
  kubectl explain projects
  kubectl explain projects.spec
----

Not all resources may have detailed output.

. Add the following content to a file named `project.yaml`:

[,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: management.cattle.io/v3
  kind: Project
  metadata:
    # name should be unique across all projects in every cluster
    name: p-abc123
    # generateName can be used instead of `name` to randomly generate a name.
    # generateName: p-
    # namespace should match spec.ClusterName.
    namespace: local
  spec:
    # clusterName should match `metadata.Name` of the target cluster.
    clusterName: local
    description: Example Project
    # displayName is the human-readable name and is visible from the UI.
    displayName: Example
----

. Create the project:

[,bash]
----
  kubectl create -f project.yaml
----

. Delete the project:

How you delete the project depends on how you created the project name.

*A. If you used `name` when creating the project*:

 ```bash
 kubectl delete -f project.yaml
 ```

*B. If you used `generateName`*:

....
Replace `$PROJECT_NAME` with the randomly generated name of the project displayed by Kubectl after you created the project.

```bash
kubectl delete project $PROJECT_NAME -n local
```
....

== Specifying CA Certs

To ensure that your tools can recognize Rancher's CA certificates, most setups require additional modifications to the above template.

. In the upper left corner, click *☰ > Global Settings*.
. Find and copy the value in the `ca-certs` field.
. Save the value in a file named `rancher.crt`.
[NOTE]
====
  If your Rancher instance is proxied by another service, you must extract the certificate that the service is using, and add it to the kubeconfig file, as demonstrated in step 5.
====


. The following commands convert `rancher.crt` to base64 output, trim all new-lines, and update the cluster in the kubeconfig with the certificate, then finish by removing the `rancher.crt` file:

[,bash]
----
  export KUBECONFIG=$PATH_TO_RANCHER_KUBECONFIG
  kubectl config set clusters.rancher.certificate-authority-data $(cat rancher.crt | base64 -i - | tr -d '\n')
  rm rancher.crt
----

. (Optional) If you use self-signed certificatess that aren't trusted by your system, you can set the insecure option in your kubeconfig with kubectl:
[WARNING]
====

This option shouldn't be used in production as it is a security risk.
====


[,bash]
----
  export KUBECONFIG=$PATH_TO_RANCHER_KUBECONFIG
  kubectl config set clusters.rancher.insecure-skip-tls-verify true
----

If your Rancher instance is proxied by another service, you must extract the certificate that the service is using, and add it to the kubeconfig file, as demonstrated above.
