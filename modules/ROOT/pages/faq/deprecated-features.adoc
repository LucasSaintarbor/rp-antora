=== What can I expect when a feature is marked for deprecation?

In the release where functionality is marked as "Deprecated", it will still be available and supported allowing upgrades to follow the usual procedure. Once upgraded, users/admins should start planning to move away from the deprecated functionality before upgrading to the release it marked as removed. The recommendation for new deployments is to not use the deprecated feature.
