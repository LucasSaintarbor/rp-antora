= Rancher Azure Quick Start Guide
:description: Read this step by step Rancher Azure guide to quickly deploy a Rancher server with a single-node downstream Kubernetes cluster attached.

The following steps will quickly deploy a Rancher server on Azure in a single-node K3s Kubernetes cluster, with a single-node downstream Kubernetes cluster attached.
[CAUTION]
====

The intent of these guides is to quickly launch a sandbox that you can use to evaluate Rancher. These guides are not intended for production environments. For comprehensive setup instructions, see xref:../../installation-and-upgrade/installation-and-upgrade.adoc[Installation].

== Prerequisites
[CAUTION]
====

Deploying to Microsoft Azure will incur charges.

* https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/[Microsoft Azure Account]: A Microsoft Azure Account is required to create resources for deploying Rancher and Kubernetes.
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription#create-a-subscription-in-the-azure-portal[Microsoft Azure Subscription]: Use this link to follow a tutorial to create a Microsoft Azure subscription if you don't have one yet.
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant[Micsoroft Azure Tenant]: Use this link and follow instructions to create a Microsoft Azure tenant.
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal[Microsoft Azure Client ID/Secret]: Use this link and follow instructions to create a Microsoft Azure client and secret.
* https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html[Terraform]: Used to provision the server and cluster in Microsoft Azure.

== Getting Started

. Clone https://github.com/rancher/quickstart[Rancher Quickstart] to a folder using `+git clone https://github.com/rancher/quickstart+`.
. Go into the Azure folder containing the Terraform files by executing `cd quickstart/rancher/azure`.
. Rename the `terraform.tfvars.example` file to `terraform.tfvars`.
. Edit `terraform.tfvars` and customize the following variables:
 ** `azure_subscription_id` - Microsoft Azure Subscription ID
 ** `azure_client_id` - Microsoft Azure Client ID
 ** `azure_client_secret` - Microsoft Azure Client Secret
 ** `azure_tenant_id` - Microsoft Azure Tenant ID
 ** `rancher_server_admin_password` - Admin password for created Rancher server. See link:../../installation-and-upgrade/resources/bootstrap-password.adoc#password-requirements[Setting up the Bootstrap Password] for password requirments.
. *Optional:* Modify optional variables within `terraform.tfvars`.
See the https://github.com/rancher/quickstart[Quickstart Readme] and the https://github.com/rancher/quickstart/tree/master/rancher/azure[Azure Quickstart Readme] for more information. Suggestions include:
 ** `azure_location` - Microsoft Azure region, choose the closest instead of the default (`East US`)
 ** `prefix` - Prefix for all created resources
 ** `instance_type` - Compute instance size used, minimum is `Standard_DS2_v2` but `Standard_DS2_v3` or `Standard_DS3_v2` could be used if within budget
 ** `add_windows_node` - If true, an additional Windows worker node is added to the workload cluster
 ** `windows_admin_password` - The admin password of the windows worker node
. Run `terraform init`.
. To initiate the creation of the environment, run `terraform apply --auto-approve`. Then wait for output similar to the following:
+
----
 Apply complete! Resources: 16 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

 Outputs:

 rancher_node_ip = xx.xx.xx.xx
 rancher_server_url = https://rancher.xx.xx.xx.xx.sslip.io
 workload_node_ip = yy.yy.yy.yy
----

. Paste the `rancher_server_url` from the output above into the browser. Log in when prompted (default username is `admin`, use the password set in `rancher_server_admin_password`).
. ssh to the Rancher Server using the `id_rsa` key generated in `quickstart/rancher/azure`.

==== Result

Two Kubernetes clusters are deployed into your Azure account, one running Rancher Server and the other ready for experimentation deployments. Please note that while this setup is a great way to explore Rancher functionality, a production setup should follow our high availability setup guidelines. SSH keys for the VMs are auto-generated and stored in the module directory.

=== What's Next?

Use Rancher to create a deployment. For more information, see xref:../deploy-workloads/deploy-workloads.adoc[Creating Deployments].

== Destroying the Environment

. From the `quickstart/rancher/azure` folder, execute `terraform destroy --auto-approve`.
. Wait for confirmation that all resources have been destroyed.
