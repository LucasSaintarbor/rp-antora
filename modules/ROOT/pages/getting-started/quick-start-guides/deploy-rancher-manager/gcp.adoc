= Rancher GCP Quick Start Guide
:description: Read this step by step Rancher GCP guide to quickly deploy a Rancher server with a single-node downstream Kubernetes cluster attached.

The following steps will quickly deploy a Rancher server on GCP in a single-node K3s Kubernetes cluster, with a single-node downstream Kubernetes cluster attached.
[CAUTION]
====

The intent of these guides is to quickly launch a sandbox that you can use to evaluate Rancher. These guides are not intended for production environments. For comprehensive setup instructions, see xref:../../installation-and-upgrade/installation-and-upgrade.adoc[Installation].
====


== Prerequisites
[CAUTION]
====

Deploying to Google GCP will incur charges.
====


* https://console.cloud.google.com/[Google GCP Account]: A Google GCP Account is required to create resources for deploying Rancher and Kubernetes.
* https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/building-app/creating-project[Google GCP Project]: Use this link to follow a tutorial to create a GCP Project if you don't have one yet.
* https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys[Google GCP Service Account]: Use this link and follow instructions to create a GCP service account and token file.
* https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html[Terraform]: Used to provision the server and cluster in Google GCP.

== Getting Started

. Clone https://github.com/rancher/quickstart[Rancher Quickstart] to a folder using `+git clone https://github.com/rancher/quickstart+`.
. Go into the GCP folder containing the Terraform files by executing `cd quickstart/rancher/gcp`.
. Rename the `terraform.tfvars.example` file to `terraform.tfvars`.
. Edit `terraform.tfvars` and customize the following variables:
 ** `gcp_account_json` - GCP service account file path and file name
 ** `rancher_server_admin_password` - Admin password for created Rancher server. See link:../../installation-and-upgrade/resources/bootstrap-password.adoc#password-requirements[Setting up the Bootstrap Password] for password requirments.
. *Optional:* Modify optional variables within `terraform.tfvars`.
See the https://github.com/rancher/quickstart[Quickstart Readme] and the https://github.com/rancher/quickstart/tree/master/rancher/gcp[GCP Quickstart Readme] for more information.
Suggestions include:
 ** `gcp_region` - Google GCP region, choose the closest instead of the default (`us-east4`)
 ** `gcp_zone` - Google GCP zone, choose the closest instead of the default (`us-east4-a`)
 ** `prefix` - Prefix for all created resources
 ** `machine_type` - Compute instance size used, minimum is `n1-standard-1` but `n1-standard-2` or `n1-standard-4` could be used if within budget
. Run `terraform init`.
. To initiate the creation of the environment, run `terraform apply --auto-approve`. Then wait for output similar to the following:
+
----
 Apply complete! Resources: 16 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

 Outputs:

 rancher_node_ip = xx.xx.xx.xx
 rancher_server_url = https://rancher.xx.xx.xx.xx.sslip.io
 workload_node_ip = yy.yy.yy.yy
----

. Paste the `rancher_server_url` from the output above into the browser. Log in when prompted (default username is `admin`, use the password set in `rancher_server_admin_password`).
. ssh to the Rancher Server using the `id_rsa` key generated in `quickstart/rancher/gcp`.

==== Result

Two Kubernetes clusters are deployed into your GCP account, one running Rancher Server and the other ready for experimentation deployments. Please note that while this setup is a great way to explore Rancher functionality, a production setup should follow our high availability setup guidelines. SSH keys for the VMs are auto-generated and stored in the module directory.

=== What's Next?

Use Rancher to create a deployment. For more information, see xref:../deploy-workloads/deploy-workloads.adoc[Creating Deployments].

== Destroying the Environment

. From the `quickstart/rancher/gcp` folder, execute `terraform destroy --auto-approve`.
. Wait for confirmation that all resources have been destroyed.
