= Rancher Outscale Quick Start Guide
:description: Read this step by step Rancher Outscale guide to quickly deploy a Rancher server with a single-node downstream Kubernetes cluster attached.

The following steps will quickly deploy a Rancher server on Outscale in a single-node K3s Kubernetes cluster, with a single-node downstream Kubernetes cluster attached.
[NOTE]
====

The intent of these guides is to quickly launch a sandbox that you can use to evaluate Rancher. These guides are not intended for production environments. For comprehensive setup instructions, see xref:../../installation-and-upgrade/installation-and-upgrade.adoc[Installation].
====


== Prerequisites
[CAUTION]
====

Deploying to Outscale will incur charges.
====


* https://en.outscale.com/[Outscale Account]: You will require an account on Outscale as this is where the server and cluster will run.
* https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Access-Keys.html[Outscale Access Key]: Use these instructions to create an Outscale Access Key if you don't have one.
* https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html[Terraform]: Used to provision the server and cluster in Outscale.

== Getting Started

. Clone https://github.com/rancher/quickstart[Rancher Quickstart] to a folder using `+git clone https://github.com/rancher/quickstart+`.
. Go into the Outscale folder containing the Terraform files by executing `cd quickstart/rancher/outscale`.
. Rename the `terraform.tfvars.example` file to `terraform.tfvars`.
. Edit `terraform.tfvars` and customize the following variables:
 ** `access_key_id` - Outscale access key
 ** `secret_key_id` - Outscale secret key
 ** `rancher_server_admin_password` - Admin password for created Rancher server. See link:../../installation-and-upgrade/resources/bootstrap-password.adoc#password-requirements[Setting up the Bootstrap Password] for password requirments.
. *Optional:* Modify optional variables within `terraform.tfvars`.
See the https://github.com/rancher/quickstart[Quickstart Readme] and the https://github.com/rancher/quickstart/tree/master/rancher/outscale[Outscale Quickstart Readme] for more information.
Suggestions include:
 ** `region` - Outscale region, choose the closest instead of the default (`eu-west-2`)
 ** `prefix` - Prefix for all created resources
 ** `instance_type` - Instance type, minimum required is `tinav3.c2r4p3`
. Run `terraform init`.
. To initiate the creation of the environment, run `terraform apply --auto-approve`. Then wait for output similar to the following:
+
----
 Apply complete! Resources: 21 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

 Outputs:

 rancher_node_ip = xx.xx.xx.xx
 rancher_server_url = https://rancher.xx.xx.xx.xx.sslip.io
 workload_node_ip = yy.yy.yy.yy
----

. Paste the `rancher_server_url` from the output above into the browser. Log in when prompted (default username is `admin`, use the password set in `rancher_server_admin_password`).
. ssh to the Rancher Server using the `id_rsa` key generated in `quickstart/rancher/outscale`.

==== Result

Two Kubernetes clusters are deployed into your Outscale account, one running Rancher Server and the other ready for experimentation deployments. Please note that while this setup is a great way to explore Rancher functionality, a production setup should follow our high availability setup guidelines. SSH keys for the VMs are auto-generated and stored in the module directory.

=== What's Next?

Use Rancher to create a deployment. For more information, see xref:../deploy-workloads/deploy-workloads.adoc[Creating Deployments].

== Destroying the Environment

. From the `quickstart/rancher/outscale` folder, execute `terraform destroy --auto-approve`.
. Wait for confirmation that all resources have been destroyed.
