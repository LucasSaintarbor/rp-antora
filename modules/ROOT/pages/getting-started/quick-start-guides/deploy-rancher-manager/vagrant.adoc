= Rancher Vagrant Quick Start

The following steps quickly deploy a Rancher Server with a single node cluster attached.
[CAUTION]
====

The intent of these guides is to quickly launch a sandbox that you can use to evaluate Rancher. These guides are not intended for production environments. For comprehensive setup instructions, see xref:../../installation-and-upgrade/installation-and-upgrade.adoc[Installation].
====


== Prerequisites

* https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant]: Vagrant is required as this is used to provision the machine based on the Vagrantfile.
* https://www.virtualbox.org[Virtualbox]: The virtual machines that Vagrant provisions need to be provisioned to VirtualBox.
* At least 4GB of free RAM.

=== Note

* Vagrant will require plugins to create VirtualBox VMs. Install them with the following commands:
+
`vagrant plugin install vagrant-vboxmanage`
+
`vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`

== Getting Started

. Clone https://github.com/rancher/quickstart[Rancher Quickstart] to a folder using `+git clone https://github.com/rancher/quickstart+`.
. Go into the folder containing the Vagrantfile by executing `cd quickstart/rancher/vagrant`.
. *Optional:* Edit `config.yaml` to:
 ** Change the number of nodes and the memory allocations, if required. (`node.count`, `node.cpus`, `node.memory`)
 ** Change the password of the `admin` user for logging into Rancher. (`admin_password`)
. To initiate the creation of the environment run, `vagrant up --provider=virtualbox`.
. Once provisioning finishes, go to `+https://192.168.56.101+` in the browser. The default user/password is `admin/adminPassword`.

*Result:* Rancher Server and your Kubernetes cluster is installed on VirtualBox.

=== What's Next?

Use Rancher to create a deployment. For more information, see xref:../deploy-workloads/deploy-workloads.adoc[Creating Deployments].

== Destroying the Environment

. From the `quickstart/rancher/vagrant` folder execute `vagrant destroy -f`.
. Wait for the confirmation that all resources have been destroyed.
