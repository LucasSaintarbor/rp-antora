= Rancher Deployment Quick Start Guides
[CAUTION]
====

The intent of these guides is to quickly launch a sandbox that you can use to evaluate Rancher. These guides are not intended for production environments. For comprehensive setup instructions, see xref:../installation-and-upgrade/installation-and-upgrade.adoc[Installation].

Use this section of the docs to jump start your deployment and testing of Rancher 2.x. It contains instructions for a simple Rancher setup and some common use cases. We plan on adding more content to this section in the future.

We have Quick Start Guides for:

* xref:deploy-rancher-manager/deploy-rancher-manager.adoc[Deploying Rancher Server]: Get started running Rancher using the method most convenient for you.
* xref:deploy-workloads/deploy-workloads.adoc[Deploying Workloads]: Deploy a simple https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/[workload] and expose it, letting you access it from outside the cluster.
