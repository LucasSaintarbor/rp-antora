= Skip Tests
:experimental:

CIS scans can be run using test profiles with user-defined skips.

To skip tests, you will create a custom CIS scan profile. A profile contains the configuration for the CIS scan, which includes the benchmark versions to use and any specific tests to skip in that benchmark.

. In the upper left corner, click *☰ > Cluster Management*.
. On the *Clusters* page, go to the cluster where you want to run a CIS scan and click *Explore*.
. Click menu:CIS Benchmark[Profile].
. From here, you can create a profile in multiple ways. To make a new profile, click *Create* and fill out the form in the UI. To make a new profile based on an existing profile, go to the existing profile and click *⋮ Clone*.  If you are filling out the form, add the tests to skip using the test IDs, using the relevant CIS Benchmark as a reference. If you are creating the new test profile as YAML, you will add the IDs of the tests to skip in the `skipTests` directive. You will also give the profile a name:
