You can always assign a pod security policy (PSP) to an existing project if you didn't assign one during creation.

=== Prerequisites

* Create a Pod Security Policy within Rancher. Before you can assign a default PSP to an existing project, you must have a PSP available for assignment. For instruction, see xref:../../new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/create-pod-security-policies.adoc[Creating Pod Security Policies].
* Assign a default Pod Security Policy to the project's cluster. You can't assign a PSP to a project until one is already applied to the cluster. For more information, see xref:../../new-user-guides/manage-clusters/add-a-pod-security-policy.adoc[the documentation about adding a pod security policy to a cluster].

=== Applying a Pod Security Policy

. In the upper left corner, click *☰ > Cluster Management*.
. On the *Clusters* page, go to the cluster where you want to move a namespace and click *Explore*.
. Click menu:Cluster[Projects/Namespaces].
. Find the project that you want to add a PSP to. From that project, select *⋮ > Edit Config*.
. From the *Pod Security Policy* drop-down, select the PSP you want to apply to the project.
  Assigning a PSP to a project will:

* Override the cluster's default PSP.
* Apply the PSP to the project.
* Apply the PSP to any namespaces you add to the project later.

. Click *Save*.

*Result:* The PSP is applied to the project and any namespaces added to the project.
[NOTE]
====

Any workloads that are already running in a cluster or project before a PSP is assigned will not be checked to determine if they comply with the PSP. Workloads would need to be cloned or upgraded to see if they pass the PSP.
