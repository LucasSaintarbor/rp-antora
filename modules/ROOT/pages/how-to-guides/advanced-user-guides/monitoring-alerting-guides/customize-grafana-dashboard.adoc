= Customizing Grafana Dashboards
:experimental:

In this section, you'll learn how to customize the Grafana dashboard to show metrics that apply to a certain container.

=== Prerequisites

Before you can customize a Grafana dashboard, the `rancher-monitoring` application must be installed.

To see the links to the external monitoring UIs, including Grafana dashboards, you will need at least a link:../../../integrations-in-rancher/monitoring-and-alerting/rbac-for-monitoring.adoc#users-with-rancher-based-permissions[project-member role.]

=== Signing in to Grafana

. In the Rancher UI, go to the cluster that has the dashboard you want to customize.
. In the left navigation menu, click *Monitoring.*
. Click *Grafana.* The Grafana dashboard should open in a new tab.
. Go to the log in icon in the lower left corner and click *Sign In.*
. Log in to Grafana. The default Admin username and password for the Grafana instance is `admin/prom-operator`. (Regardless of who has the password, cluster administrator permission in Rancher is still required access the Grafana instance.) Alternative credentials can also be supplied on deploying or upgrading the chart.

=== Getting the PromQL Query Powering a Grafana Panel

For any panel, you can click the title and click *Explore* to get the PromQL queries powering the graphic.

For this example, we would like to get the CPU usage for the Alertmanager container, so we click menu:CPU Utilization[Inspect.]

The *Data* tab shows the underlying data as a time series, with the time in first column and the PromQL query result in the second column. Copy the PromQL query.

----
(1 - (avg(irate({__name__=~"node_cpu_seconds_total|windows_cpu_time_total",mode="idle"}[5m])))) * 100
----

You can then modify the query in the Grafana panel or create a new Grafana panel using the query.
