= Local Authentication

Local authentication is the default until you configure an external authentication provider. Rancher stores user account information, such as usernames and passwords, locally. By default, the `admin` user that logs in to Rancher for the first time is a local user.

== Adding Local Users

Regardless of whether you use external authentication, you should create a few local authentication users so that you can continue using Rancher if your external authentication service encounters issues.
