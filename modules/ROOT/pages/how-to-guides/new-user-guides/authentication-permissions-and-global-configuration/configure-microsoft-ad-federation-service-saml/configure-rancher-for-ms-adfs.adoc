= 2. Configuring Rancher for Microsoft AD FS

After you complete xref:configure-ms-adfs-for-rancher.adoc[Configuring Microsoft AD FS for Rancher], enter your Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS) information into Rancher so that AD FS users can authenticate with Rancher.
[NOTE]
.Important Notes For Configuring Your ADFS Server:
====

* The SAML 2.0 WebSSO Protocol Service URL is: `https://<RANCHER_SERVER>/v1-saml/adfs/saml/acs`
* The Relying Party Trust identifier URL is: `https://<RANCHER_SERVER>/v1-saml/adfs/saml/metadata`
* You must export the `federationmetadata.xml` file from your AD FS server. This can be found at: `https://<AD_SERVER>/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml`
====


. In the top left corner, click *â˜° > Users & Authentication*.
. In the left navigation menu, click *Auth Provider*.
