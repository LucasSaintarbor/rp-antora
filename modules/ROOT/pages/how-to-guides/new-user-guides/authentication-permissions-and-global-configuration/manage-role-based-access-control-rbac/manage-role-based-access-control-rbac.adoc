= Managing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Within Rancher, each person authenticates as a _user_, which is a login that grants you access to Rancher. As mentioned in xref:../authentication-config/authentication-config.adoc[Authentication], users can either be local or external.

After you configure external authentication, the users that display on the *Users* page changes.

* If you are logged in as a local user, only local users display.
* If you are logged in as an external user, both external and local users display.

== Users and Roles

Once the user logs in to Rancher, their _authorization_, or their access rights within the system, is determined by _global permissions_, and _cluster and project roles_.

* xref:global-permissions.adoc[Global Permissions]:
+
Define user authorization outside the scope of any particular cluster.

* xref:cluster-and-project-roles.adoc[Cluster and Project Roles]:
+
Define user authorization inside the specific cluster or project where they are assigned the role.

Both global permissions and cluster and project roles are implemented on top of https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[Kubernetes RBAC]. Therefore, enforcement of permissions and roles is performed by Kubernetes.
