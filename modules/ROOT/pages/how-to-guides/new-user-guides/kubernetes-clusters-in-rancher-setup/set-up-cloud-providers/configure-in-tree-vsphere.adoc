= Setting Up an In-tree VMware vSphere Cloud Provider

To set up the in-tree VMware vSphere cloud provider, follow these steps while creating the vSphere cluster in Rancher:

. Set *Cloud Provider* option to `Custom` or `Custom (In-Tree)`.
. Click on *Edit as YAML*
. Insert the following structure to the pre-populated cluster YAML. This structure must be placed under `rancher_kubernetes_engine_config`. Note that the `name` _must_ be set to `vsphere`.

 rancher_kubernetes_engine_config:
   cloud_provider:
       name: vsphere
       vsphereCloudProvider:
           [Insert provider configuration]
----

Rancher uses RKE (the Rancher Kubernetes Engine) to provision Kubernetes clusters. Refer to the https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/config-options/cloud-providers/vsphere/config-reference/[vSphere configuration reference in the RKE documentation] for details about the properties of the `vsphereCloudProvider` directive.
