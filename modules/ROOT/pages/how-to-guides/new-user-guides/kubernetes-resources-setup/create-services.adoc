= Services
:experimental:

Pod configuration is managed by Deployments, StatefulSets and Daemonsets, whereas services direct traffic to pods using selectors.

For every workload (with at least one port configured) created, a complementing Service Discovery entry is created. This Service Discovery entry enables DNS resolution for the workload's pods using the following naming convention:
`<workload>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`.

You can create additional services so that a given namespace resolves with one or more external IP addresses, an external hostname, an alias to another DNS record, other workloads, or a set of pods that match a selector that you create.

. In the upper left corner, click *â˜° > Cluster Management*.
. Go to the cluster where you want to add a service and click *Explore*.
. Click menu:Service Discovery[Services].
. Click *Create*.
. Choose the type of service you want to create.
. Select a *Namespace* from the drop-down list.
. Enter a *Name* for the service. This name is used for DNS resolution.
. Fill out the rest of the form. For help, refer to the upstream Kubernetes documentation about https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/[services.]
. Click *Create*.

*Result:* A new service is created.

* You can view the record by from the project's *Service Discovery* tab.
* When you visit the new DNS name for the new record that you created (`<recordname>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`), it resolves the chosen namespace.
