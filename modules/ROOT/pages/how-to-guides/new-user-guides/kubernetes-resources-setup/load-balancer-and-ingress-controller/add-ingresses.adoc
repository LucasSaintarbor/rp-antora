Ingresses can be added for workloads to provide load balancing, SSL termination and host/path based routing. When using ingresses in a project, you can program the ingress hostname to an external DNS by setting up a Global DNS entry.

. In the upper left corner, click *â˜° > Cluster Management*.
. Go to the cluster that you want to add an ingress to and click *Explore*.
. Click menu:Service Discovery[Ingresses].
. Click *Create*.
. Select an existing *Namespace* from the drop-down list.
. Enter a *Name* for the ingress.
. xref:./ingress-configuration.adoc[Create] ingress forwarding *Rules*. If any of your ingress rules handle requests for encrypted ports, add a certificate to encrypt/decrypt communications.
. *Optional:* click *Add Rule* to create additional ingress rules. For example, after you create ingress rules to direct requests for your hostname, you'll likely want to create a default backend to handle 404s.
. Click *Create* at the bottom right.

*Result:* Your ingress is added to the project. The ingress begins enforcing your ingress rules.
