= Adding Users to Clusters

If you want to provide a user with access and permissions to _all_ projects, nodes, and resources within a cluster, assign the user a cluster membership.
[TIP]
====

Want to provide a user with access to a _specific_ project within a cluster? See xref:../../../new-user-guides/add-users-to-projects.adoc[Adding Project Members] instead.
====


There are two contexts where you can add cluster members:

* Adding Members to a New Cluster
+
You can add members to a cluster as you create it (recommended if possible).

* <<editing-cluster-membership,Adding Members to an Existing Cluster>>
+
You can always add members to a cluster after a cluster is provisioned.

== Editing Cluster Membership

Cluster administrators can edit the membership for a cluster, controlling which Rancher users can access the cluster and what features they can use.

. Click *☰ > Cluster Management*.
. Go to the cluster you want to add members to and click *⋮ > Edit Config*.
. In the *Member Roles* tab, click *Add Member*.
. Search for the user or group that you want to add to the cluster.
+
If external authentication is configured:

 ** Rancher returns users from your xref:../../authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/authentication-config.adoc[external authentication] source as you type.
+
[NOTE]
.Using AD but can't find your users?
====
+
There may be an issue with your search attribute configuration. See xref:../../../new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-active-directory.adoc[Configuring Active Directory Authentication: Step 5].
+
====


 ** A drop-down allows you to add groups instead of individual users. The drop-down only lists groups that you, the logged in user, are part of.
+
[NOTE]
====
+
If you are logged in as a local user, external users do not display in your search results. For more information, see link:../../authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/authentication-config.adoc#external-authentication-configuration-and-principal-users[External Authentication Configuration and Principal Users].
+
====


. Assign the user or group *Cluster* roles.
+
xref:../../../new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/cluster-and-project-roles.adoc[What are Cluster Roles?]
+
[TIP]
====
+
For Custom Roles, you can modify the list of individual roles available for assignment.

 ** To add roles to the list, xref:../../../new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/custom-roles.adoc[Add a Custom Role].
 ** To remove roles from the list, xref:../../../new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/locked-roles.adoc[Lock/Unlock Roles].

+
====


*Result:* The chosen users are added to the cluster.

* To revoke cluster membership, select the user and click *Delete*. This action deletes membership, not the user.
* To modify a user's roles in the cluster, delete them from the cluster, and then re-add them with modified roles.
