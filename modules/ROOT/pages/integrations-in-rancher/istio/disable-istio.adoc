= Disabling Istio
:experimental:

This section describes how to uninstall Istio in a cluster or disable a namespace, or workload.

== Uninstall Istio in a Cluster

To uninstall Istio,

. Click *☰ > Cluster Management*.
. Go to the cluster that you created and click *Explore*.
. In the left navigation bar, click menu:Apps[Installed Apps].
. In the `istio-system` namespace, go to `rancher-istio` and click *⋮ > Delete*.
. After `rancher-istio` is deleted, you can then select all the remaining apps in the `istio-system` namespace and click *Delete*.

*Result:* The `rancher-istio` app in the cluster gets removed. The Istio sidecar cannot be deployed on any workloads in the cluster.
[NOTE]
====

You can no longer disable and re-enable your Istio installation. If you would like to save your settings for a future install, view and save individual YAMLs to refer back to / reuse for future installations.
====


*Troubleshooting Uninstall:* If you didn't follow the uninstall steps, you may encounter a warning during uninstall:

`Error: uninstallation completed with 1 error(s): unable to build kubernetes objects for delete: unable to recognize "": no matches for kind "MonitoringDashboard" in version "monitoring.kiali.io/v1alpha1"`

This could mean a few things. You either selected all the apps in the `istio-system` namespace and deleted them at the same time, or you deleted `rancher-istio` chart dependencies prior to deleting the `rancher-istio` chart. Since the uninstall did not complete properly, you will have resources remaining in the `istio-system` namespace that you will need to manually clean up. Another option to avoid manual clean up is to install `rancher-istio` again, then uninstall it in the correct order.

== Disable Istio in a Namespace

. Click *☰ > Cluster Management*.
. Go to the cluster that you created and click *Explore*.
. Click menu:Cluster[Projects/Namespaces].
. Go to the namespace where you want to enable Istio and click *⋮  > Enable Istio Auto Injection*. Alternately, click the namespace, and then on the namespace detail page, click *⋮  > Enable Istio Auto Injection*.

*Result:* When workloads are deployed in this namespace, they will not have the Istio sidecar.

== Remove the Istio Sidecar from a Workload

Disable Istio in the namespace, then redeploy the workloads with in it. They will be deployed without the Istio sidecar.
