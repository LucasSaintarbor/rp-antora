= Rancher CLI
:description: Interact with Rancher using command line interface (CLI) tools from your workstation.

The Rancher CLI (Command Line Interface) is a unified tool that you can use to interact with Rancher. With this tool, you can operate Rancher using a command line rather than the GUI.

=== Download Rancher CLI

The binary can be downloaded directly from the UI.

. In the upper left corner, click *â˜°*.
. At the bottom of the navigation sidebar menu, click *About*.
. Under the *CLI Downloads section*, there are links to download the binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can also check the https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases[releases page for our CLI] for direct downloads of the binary.

=== Requirements

After you download the Rancher CLI, you need to make a few configurations. Rancher CLI requires:

* Your Rancher Server URL, which is used to connect to Rancher Server.
* An API Bearer Token, which is used to authenticate with Rancher. For more information about obtaining a Bearer Token, see xref:../user-settings/api-keys.adoc[Creating an API Key].

=== CLI Authentication

Before you can use Rancher CLI to control your Rancher Server, you must authenticate using an API Bearer Token. Log in using the following command (replace `<BEARER_TOKEN>` and `<SERVER_URL>` with your information):

[,bash]
----
$ ./rancher login https://<SERVER_URL> --token <BEARER_TOKEN>
----

If Rancher Server uses a self-signed certificate, Rancher CLI prompts you to continue with the connection.

=== Project Selection

Before you can perform any commands, you must select a Rancher project to perform those commands against. To select a xref:../../how-to-guides/new-user-guides/manage-clusters/projects-and-namespaces.adoc[project] to work on, use the command `./rancher context switch`. When you enter this command, a list of available projects displays. Enter a number to choose your project.

*Example: `./rancher context switch` Output*

----
User:rancher-cli-directory user$ ./rancher context switch
NUMBER    CLUSTER NAME   PROJECT ID              PROJECT NAME
1         cluster-2      c-7q96s:p-h4tmb         project-2
2         cluster-2      c-7q96s:project-j6z6d   Default
3         cluster-1      c-lchzv:p-xbpdt         project-1
4         cluster-1      c-lchzv:project-s2mch   Default
Select a Project:
----

After you enter a number, the console displays a message that you've changed projects.

----
INFO[0005] Setting new context to project project-1
INFO[0005] Saving config to /Users/markbishop/.ranchcli2.json
----

Ensure you can run `rancher kubectl get pods` successfully.
