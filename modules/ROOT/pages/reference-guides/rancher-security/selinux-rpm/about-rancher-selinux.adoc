= About rancher-selinux

To allow Rancher to work with SELinux, some functionality has to be manually enabled for the SELinux nodes. To help with that, Rancher provides a SELinux RPM.

The `rancher-selinux` RPM only contains policies for the https://github.com/rancher/charts/tree/dev-v2.5/charts/rancher-logging[rancher-logging application.]

The `rancher-selinux` GitHub repository is https://github.com/rancher/rancher-selinux[here.]

The rancher-selinux RPM was tested with CentOS 7, 8 and 9.
====


=== 1. Set up the yum repo

Set up the yum repo to install `rancher-selinux` directly on all hosts in the cluster.

In order to use the RPM repository, on a CentOS 7 or RHEL 7 system, run the following bash snippet:

----
# cat << EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/rancher.repo
[rancher]
name=Rancher
baseurl=https://rpm.rancher.io/rancher/production/centos/7/noarch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://rpm.rancher.io/public.key
EOF
----

In order to use the RPM repository, on a CentOS 8 or RHEL 8 system, run the following bash snippet:

----
# cat << EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/rancher.repo
[rancher]
name=Rancher
baseurl=https://rpm.rancher.io/rancher/production/centos/8/noarch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://rpm.rancher.io/public.key
EOF
----

In order to use the RPM repository, on a CentOS 9 or RHEL 9 system, run the following bash snippet:

----
# cat << EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/rancher.repo
[rancher]
name=Rancher
baseurl=https://rpm.rancher.io/rancher/production/centos/9/noarch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://rpm.rancher.io/public.key
EOF

Install the RPM:

----
yum -y install rancher-selinux

== Configuring the Logging Application to Work with SELinux
[NOTE]
.Requirement:
====

Logging v2 was tested with SELinux on RHEL/CentOS 7, 8 and 9.
====


Applications do not automatically work once the `rancher-selinux` RPM is installed on the host. They need to be configured to run in an allowed SELinux container domain provided by the RPM.

To configure the `rancher-logging` chart to be SELinux aware, change `global.seLinux.enabled` to true in the `values.yaml` when installing the chart.
