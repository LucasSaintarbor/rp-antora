. Registered EKS, GKE and AKS clusters have the same options available as EKS, GKE and AKS clusters created from the Rancher UI. The  difference is that when a registered cluster is deleted from the Rancher UI, it is not destroyed.
. Cluster configuration options can't be edited for registered clusters, except for xref:../how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/register-existing-clusters.adoc[K3s and RKE2 clusters.]
. For registered cluster nodes, the Rancher UI exposes the ability to cordon, drain, and edit the node.
. For registered clusters using etcd as a control plane, snapshots must be taken manually outside of the Rancher UI to use for backup and recovery.
